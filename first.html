        <h1>Introduction to c++</h1>
        <p>
          C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used
          for system/software development, game development, and applications
          requiring close hardware interaction. It is an extension of the C
          language, adding object-oriented features such as classes and
          inheritance.
        </p>
        <h2>features of c++</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</li>
          <p>C++ supports the four pillars of object-oriented programming:</p>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data in
            a single unit (class).
          </li>
          <li>
            Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only
            necessary functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inheritance: Mechanism to create a new class from an existing class
            to promote code reuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Polymorphism: Ability to treat objects of different derived classes
            uniformly through base class pointers or references.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Features of C++</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Object-Oriented: C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP)
            principles, allowing for the creation of classes and objects. This
            helps in organizing code and promoting reusability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rich Standard Library: C++ provides a rich set of built-in functions
            and libraries, which can significantly reduce the development time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performance: C++ offers low-level memory manipulation, allowing
            developers to optimize performance-critical applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Portability: C++ programs can be compiled and run on various
            platforms without significant modifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compatibility with C: C++ is compatible with C, allowing for the
            integration of existing C code.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
        <pre style="background-color: aqua">
            <code>
                #include &lt;iostream&gt;
                    #include &lt;string&gt;
                    using namespace std;
                    
                    int main() 
                    {
                        string name;
                        cout << "Enter name:";
                        getline (cin, name);
                        cout << "Hello " << name;
                        return 0;
                    }
            </code>
         </pre>
        <h3>Applications of C++</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            System Software: C++ is used in developing operating systems and
            system-level applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Game Development: Many game engines and games are written in C++ due
            to its performance and control over system resources.
          </li>
          <li>

        <h3>What is Arrays</h3>
        <p>
          In programming, arrays are data structures that store a collection of
          elements (values), typically of the same data type, in contiguous
          memory locations. Arrays are used to group related data together so
          that they can be easily accessed, modified, and manipulated.

        <h2>Introduction to Trees</h2>
        <p>
          A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes
          connected by edges. Each tree has a single root node at the top, from
          which all other nodes branch out. Nodes can have zero or more child
          nodes, and each child node can further branch out into more nodes.
          Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships, such
          as file systems or organizational structures.

          <li>
            Height: The number of edges on the longest path from a node to a
            leaf.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Trees</h3>

            left and right children.
          </li>
          <li>
            Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child
            contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the
            right child contains only nodes with values greater than the parent
            node.
          </li>
          <li>
            AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference
            in heights between the left and right subtrees is at most one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Red-Black Tree: A balanced binary search tree with an additional
            property that ensures the tree remains balanced during insertions
            and deletions.

        <h2>Introduction to Graphs</h2>
        <p>
          A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or
          nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are
          used to represent relationships or connections between various
          entities and are fundamental in computer science for modeling complex
          networks, such as social networks, transportation systems, and
          communication networks.

        <h3>Characteristics of Graphs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Vertices (Nodes): The fundamental units of a graph, representing
            entities in the graph.
          </li>
          <li>
            Edges: Connections between pairs of vertices, which can be directed
            (one-way) or undirected (two-way).
          </li>
          <li>
            Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex. For directed
            graphs, a vertex can have an in-degree (number of incoming edges)
            and an out-degree (number of outgoing edges).
          </li>
          <li>
            Path: A sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices
          </li>

            Unweighted Graph: A graph where all edges are treated equally,
            without any weights.
